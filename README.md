In this project, we focused on Chart Question Answering (CQA) task which focuses on answering questions about the various information presented in chart images or graph images. In order to answer questions regarding charts or graphs, a machine learning model has been trained on a set of questions and features of the chart or graphs, and the model learns to extract all relevant information from the chart images and then they answer the question based on that information.
Our work focuses on exploring the transfer learning capabilities of a fine-tuned model on a CQA task. Specifically, we evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the grey scaled images from the PlotQA dataset, which is significantly different from the original colored images from the PlotQA dataset on which the model was originally trained. The findings of this study suggest that model performs better with colored images
